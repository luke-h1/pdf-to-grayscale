# pdf-to-grayscale

simple script to convert pdf to grayscale format

```
brew install pdftk-java # install pdf core lib that the script calls
brew install ghostscript # install ghostscript for color conversion
```

## why?

Don't want to pay for an adobe subscription when we can do it with python instead ;)

## Contributing

No intention to maintain this with it being so simple but a few areas that we could improve are:

- Add a flag to specify the output directory
- Add support for multiple files to be converted
- Add support for multi system arch (linux, windows, mac etc.)
